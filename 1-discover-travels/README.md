This example of a web page is created mainly to demonstrate the back-end functionality. It fully implements the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), CRUD operations, and REST API. A recursive function is created on this page to display comments with their functionality, which significantly reduces the load on the database as it is implemented using the Primary-Secondary key principle, which MongoDB does not support. Additionally, secure page connection to the database is implemented.

The following libraries are used in the project:

- express, mongoose, dotenv, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, cors
- react-router-dom, @phosphor-icons/react, axios, react-auth-kit, @auth-kit/react-router
